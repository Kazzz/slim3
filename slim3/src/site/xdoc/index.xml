				Slim3 is a full-stack web application framework for agile development.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our main concept is "Simple" and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism#Minimalist_design">"Less Is More"</a>.
				"Less is more" means simplicity and clarity lead to good design.
			</p>
			<p>
				80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
				We concentrate all our energies into 20% of the causes.
				Programmers can resolve the other issues without framework constraints.
			</p>
			<p>
				We want to get rid of complex and wasted features from your applications and our framework.
				As a result, we will slim down.
			</p>

                Slim3 is a Java open source framework.
                The license is <a href="license.html">"The Apache Software License, Version 2.0"</a>.
            </p>

				The main characteristics of Slim3 are as follows: 
				<ul>
				<li><a href="#HOT_deployment">HOT deployment</a></li>
				<li><a href="#Less_configuration">Less configuration</a></li>
				<li><a href="#Less_learning_cost">Less learning cost</a></li>
				</ul>

			<subsection name="HOT deployment">
            <p>
                HOT deployment means re-deployment an application without restarting web application.
                Due to HOT deployment, you can see the resultã€€as soon as you change the source code.
                The quick feedback is essence of agile development.

			<subsection name="Less configuration">
			<p>
				Do you want to write configuration files or not?
			</p>
			<p>
				Sure, you don't want to write them.
				Slim3 employs <b>Convention over Configuration(CoC)</b> and <b>Annotations</b> properly,
				so you don't need to write bloated configuration files.
			</p>
			<p>
			    If <b>CoC</b> is abused,
			    your source code will be hard to understand.
			    If <b>Annotations</b> is used too much,
                you will fall into <b>ANNOTATIONS HELL</b>.
                It is important to use <b>CoC</b> and <b>Annotations</b> properly.

                Slim3 is a thin wrapper on Struts 1.2 and JDBC.
                If you know them, you can learn Slim3 quickly.
                Many developers know Struts and JDBC.
                Slim3 is based on popular technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, you can use Struts without bloated configuration files!!!
